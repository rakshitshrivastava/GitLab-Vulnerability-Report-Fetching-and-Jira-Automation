# GitLab-Vulnerability-Report-Fetching-and-Jira-Automation

This repository contains scripts for automating the fetching of vulnerability reports from GitLab and the creation of corresponding Jira tickets. The process involves exporting vulnerability reports from GitLab, enriching the data with additional information such as GitLab links and solutions, and then creating Jira tickets based on the enriched data.

Features:

Vulnerability Report Export: Automates the export of vulnerability reports from GitLab for one or multiple projects.
Data Enrichment: Adds GitLab links and solutions to the exported CSV files.
Jira Ticket Creation: Creates Jira tickets based on the enriched data, including setting due dates and priorities based on severity.
Group and Project Selection: Allows selection of specific projects or all projects within a GitLab group for vulnerability report fetching.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
Requests library
Pandas library
Jira library

Usage:
Run the gitlab_vulnerability_export.py script to export vulnerability reports from GitLab.
Run the jira_ticket_creation.py script to create Jira tickets based on the exported data.

Instructions:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Set up a virtual environment and install the required libraries (pip install -r requirements.txt).
Configure the scripts with your GitLab and Jira credentials.
Run the scripts to automate vulnerability report fetching and Jira ticket creation.
